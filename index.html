                    You set your eyes before a large island chain. Its breadth extends past the horizon, near-endless. The waves crash against the sandy beaches, not reaching the large forests deeper inland.

                    And when the last night settled, the Worldwalker began her trek. On her back she bore the last village of humanity, built in desperation before the light faded.
                </p>
                <p>Within her halls lie a thousand statues, the last survivors in magical sleep. They were her heart---much in the same way a mortal creature could not live without one, she would have no reason to continue if they were broken. There was a simple goal she was imbued with, one that was never spoken but was imbued in the spells and tears that composed her. She would find a home for new humanity and awaken them from sleep.
