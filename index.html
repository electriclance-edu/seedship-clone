                    And when the last night settled, the Worldwalker began her trek. On her back she bore the last village of humanity, built in desperation before the light faded.
                </p>
                <p>Within her halls lie a thousand statues, the last survivors in magical sleep. They were her heart---much in the same way a mortal creature could not live without one, she would have no reason to continue if they were broken. There was a simple goal she was imbued with, one that was never spoken but was imbued in the spells and tears that composed her. She would find a home for new humanity and awaken them from sleep.
